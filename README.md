## About the Project
This portfolio website, developed as my CAPACITI AI Bootcamp capstone, serves as a digital showcase of my technical skills, projects, and professional journey. As an IT graduate from Tshwane University of Technology, I’ve built this site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to highlight my capabilities in creating user-focused, accessible web applications. The portfolio features my CAPACITI capstone and my university final-year project, a Sign Language Translation System, demonstrating my commitment to impactful and inclusive technology.

### Key Highlights
- **CAPACITI Capstone**: A responsive portfolio website with a testimonial carousel, particle animations, and accessibility features.
- **University Project**: A Sign Language Translation System using JavaScript, Ionic, MySQL, and TensorFlow.js to enhance communication for deaf communities.
- **Professional Focus**: Blending software development, AI, and cybersecurity with Google and Cisco certifications.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile (≤768px, ≤480px) and desktop devices using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
- **Testimonial Carousel**: Displays feedback from ICEP Mentors and African Bank Manager, with auto-slide (every 5 seconds) and manual navigation buttons.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Includes `Home`, `About`, `Projects`, `Skills`, `Services`, and `Contact` links, with a mobile-friendly toggle menu.
- **Particle Animation**: JavaScript-powered canvas animation in the hero section for visual engagement.
- **Accessibility**: Implements `skip-link`, `aria-labels`, and screen-reader-friendly navigation for inclusivity.
- **Form Submission**: Contact form integrated with Formspree (`xovlgkod`) for seamless communication.
- **SEO Optimization**: Includes meta tags for description, keywords, and Open Graph for better search visibility.
- **Featured Projects**: Showcases the portfolio website and Sign Language System with links to learn more (`https://nompil.github.io/My-Profile/`) or explore further (`projects.html`).
